## Google's message for export

Google is creating a copy of files from My Activity
This process can take a long time (possibly hours or days) to complete. You'll receive an email when your export is done.

Its scary, but really it takes a couple of minutes.

So my neighbor and I are working on this new project called Google wrapped. Which is basically like Spotify wrapped but for Google.

After running some algorithms on Kirill's search history we have found searches like:
"edible foot fungus"
"i have trouble pooping"
"how to open beer with a spoon" (x2)
"american dad porn comics"

Can you help by filling out this survey and optionally providing your search history so we can make a better product? https://forms.gle/nKbUe9MT4Rjobg9C6
