# December 5, Elissa feedback, Phone

56 - start

A lot of text for her to read. Use more symbols and pictures. Make it one sentence. Maximum 2 short sentences.

What is these dots - ah these are checkdots.

Change of window is unfortunate. Took time to figure out

Give hint that my activity is at the very bottom.

10-20 seconds, she knew where to look tho. Without it would be even longer.
Its in alphabetical order MM! Mention that too.

For JSON - tell to click OK.

Create export, wait for email from google. If you have email Apple Email or Gmail you should get a notification. (This part is intuitive).

Its been over 3 minutes. Roughly 3 minutes. Need a timer how long its gonna take.

Too long waiting. Maybe add a dino game.

Whats return to a website. She probably

Can't go back to the meme itself from the picker when back clicking.

Not intuitive, didn't understand you need to click stuff.

So close together on this, hard to click on a certain one. On the meme template.

Make it obvious its a button. Did not read the instructions.

#wrapped/idea Re-googling old searches. Maybe use GPT instead? :D.

No repeats in the list (show how many times did you search for it)

Order is random, timline needed.

So many, refresh button to not look at giant list. Oh, I like this combination, just go with this.

# October 28, berkley students, 2 females, 1 male all in their early 20s

## Notes

Interviewed 3 more potential users.

I am having trouble formulating the problem. It’s entertainment so like we’ll the problem is you are curious.

I have employed a different strategy and instead of poking at the problem asked Ben end Clair what they were googling and how. Once I got a response I would ask ‘would you like to know how much of X are you googling? Anything funny you think you googled in this category?’
I would also as if they would want to share with friends.

## Clara

When mentioning switching into airplane mode she was confused.
One stop shop
Would do it from extension
Incognito brought up
Not impressed ⅖ reaction
5:7 is too tall for a girl
Good memory

## Ben

Random shit
Very personal questions on Reddit
Something + Reddit
What’s a livable wage in sf
How do I heal my inner child

## Clair

Really wants to know what Kostas searched for
Keeps asking for it
Uses incognito for all the searches lazy to switch
Would never share private things she searches for with friends

## Interesting observations

Neither brought up privacy related stuff but they are pretty drunk.

# October 23, one uninterested user upfront, one user interested in statistics and horoscopes

Raw notes are in Stories google sheet.

FYI I have talked to 2 potential female users and went over 'the list' of 40 potential features with them.

The main concern as always

- how the fuck do I trust this website?
- The process of downloading your search history is very tedious..., should be more automatic. They brought up "cookie agreement that pops up on websites". Again, thats impossible for our case.

Now to the functionality:
The main concern I got was profiling - they thought political, gender, age etc profiling might upset users.

The features they liked:

- 3am drunk searches
- trendsetter or trendfollower, when did you jump on the hype train
- Which TV show character are you
- 2 truths 1 lie
- Meme generation (Galaxy, Drake, Gen Z millenal, etc). But this is really a presentation style of profiling, so same criticism applies
- Life phases timeline. Most challanging times. The format suggested was similar to what we have been considering: "In october you mostly googled Machine learning things, in november you googled how to not suicide after another project fell through, .... This year the hardest emotional time was November"
- Your top 5 diseases

Some general feedback about presentation. They want it to be INTERACTIVE first of all. So the user feels in control what kind of statistics they see. We can also then include more sensitive stats with better disclaimers of for example what algorithm we use to determine how much you have left to live.
