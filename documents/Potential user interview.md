# Interview with Masha and Natasha

FYI I have talked to 2 potential female users and went over 'the list' of 40 potential features with them.

## The main concern as always

- how the fuck do I trust this website?
- The process of downloading your search history is very tedious..., should be more automatic. They brought up "cookie agreement that pops up on websites". Again, thats impossible for our case.

## Now to the functionality:

The main concern I got was profiling - they thought political, gender, age etc profiling might upset users.

## The features they liked:

- 3am drunk searches
- trendsetter or trendfollower, when did you jump on the hype train
- Which TV show character are you
- 2 truths 1 lie
- Meme generation (Galaxy, Drake, Gen Z millenal, etc). But this is really a presentation style of profiling, so same criticism applies
- Life phases timeline. Most challanging times. The format suggested was similar to what we have been considering: "In october you mostly googled Machine learning things, in november you googled how to not suicide after another project fell through, .... This year the hardest emotional time was November"
- Your top 5 diseases

## INTERACTIVITY

Some general feedback about presentation. They want it to be INTERACTIVE first of all. So the user feels in control what kind of statistics they see. We can also then include more sensitive stats with better disclaimers of for example what algorithm we use to determine how much you have left to live.
